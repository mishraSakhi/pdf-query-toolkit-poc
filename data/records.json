We have received questions from the client on why sometimes\nusers are taken directly to the specific record they are being emailed about, while other times they are\ntaken to the native login page even though they should be directed to the SSO page worst case\nscenario. This specific use case is impacting their internal employees and we need some help with the\nsolution.\nACTION TAKEN BY SUPPORT TEAM:\n----------------------------\nThis case was transferred to us by CDS team.\nWe went on a webex call with customer and customer explained that they have a requirement to\nnavigate the notification link to OAUTH SSO url instead of native login.\nWe have suggested client to use below web.properties to help them navigate to their sso :\nFRONT_END_SERVER\nEXTERNAL FRONT END URL\nBut customer is using OAUTH sso url . The format for OAUTH SSO url for TRIRIGA is something like\nthis : https://<your-tririga-hostname>/p/oauth/<your-oauth-settings-profile-name>/tririga.\nIn our web. properties , we cannot add context path . We can add upto https://<your-tririga-hostname>\n,\nWe have replicated the issue on tas 4.5/11.5 (https://cpd96023-ibm-tas-115-prod.apps.tas-lg05.tririga-\ndev.com/index.html) and the context path it is picking up is \"index.html\"\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION GATHER FROM CUSTOMER:\n---------------------------------------\nCustomer is using TAS 4.5.1/11.5 but we do not use TAS for 4.5.1 in OOTB, hence tested with tas\n4.5/11.5.\nTheir Test and PROD URL's:\nTest Environment:\nnon SSO url - https://slb-test.suite.tririga.com/index.html\nSSO url - https://slb-test.suite.tririga.com/p/oauth/sso/tririga\nProduction Environment:\nnon SSO url - https://slb.suite.tririga.com/app/tririga/#\nSSO url - https://slb.suite.tririga.com/p/oauth/sso/tririga\nWhen they have configured FRONT_END_SERVER : https://slb-\ntest.suite.tririga.com/p/oauth/sso/tririga , they are getting this error:\nhttps://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/rest/download/TS014656566/0-\nall_data/SSO_TRIRIGA_login_attempt_2024.png?fileSize=22446&clientId=ae5 as it is picking up\nindex.html as a context path.\nSTEPS FOLLOWED TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE BY SUPPORT:\n---------------------------------------\n1. Take TAS enabled OAUTH SSO environment.\nConfigure the below web.properties:\nFRONT_END_SERVER : https://<your-tririga-hostname>\nEXTERNAL FRONT END URL : https://<your-tririga-hostname>\nAlso configure, smtp properties and wf notification properties\n2. Create 2 admin users( Include your mail Id in profile)\n3. login with user 1 , go to tasks-> manage tasks -> work task -> create a new task.\n4. Give name in general tab and go to notification tab and add second user as manual approver.\n5. save and activate.\n6. You will receive a notification mail and click on the link and you could see it is redirecting us to\nnative url.\n(CUSTOMER's PRODUCT VERSION/ENVIRONMENT DETAILS:\n--------------------------------------\n********************************************************************************\nPlatform : Tas 4.5.1\nApplication: 11.5\nproduct = WebSphere Application Server 23.0.0.10 (wlp-1.0.82.cl231020231002-1201)\nwlp.install.dir = /opt/ibm/wlp/\nserver.output.dir = /opt/ibm/wlp/output/defaultServer/\njava.home = /opt/ibm/java/jre\njava.version = 1.8.0_381\njava.runtime = Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0.8.11 - pxa6480sr8fp11-20230901_01(SR8\nFP11))\nos = Linux (4.18.0-477.27.1.el8_8.x86_64; amd64) (en_US)\nprocess = 359@172.30.224.79\nClasspath = /opt/ibm/wlp/bin/tools/ws-server.jar:/opt/ibm/wlp/bin/tools/ws-javaagent.jar\nJava Library path =\n/opt/ibm/java/jre/lib/amd64/compressedrefs:/opt/ibm/java/jre/lib/amd64:/usr/lib64:/usr/lib\n********************************************************************************\nECUREP LINK OF THE DATA SHARED BY CUSTOMER:\n--------------------------------------------\nhttps://ecurep.mainz.de.ibm.com/ae5/#id=TS014656566&path=TS014656566%2F0-all_data%2F\nWHAT IS EXPECTED OF DEVELOPMENT:\n-------------------------------\nNeed help to answer client's query on redirecting the notification links to OAUTH URL.\nRTC TICKET NUMBER WHICH MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE ISSUE\n-------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://rtc.tririga-dev.com/rtc/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/86438\nVERSION ANALYSIS\nCase Type: Standard Case\nPlatform Version: Need confirmation from customer\nApplication Version: Need confirmation from customer\nCASE FEED\n9/20/2025 1:06 PM | SCTS016842135 | CaseHistory: Status Changed | Resolution Provided > Closed -\nArchived | Mounika Chakka\nMC\n8/21/2025 12:37 PM | SCTS016842135 | CaseHistory: Internal Status Changed | SME Work Complete > IBM\nClosed | Mounika Chakka\n8/21/2025 12:37 PM | SCTS016842135 | CaseHistory: Status Changed | SME Needed > Resolution\nProvided | Mounika Chakka\n8/21/2025 12:37 PM | SCTS016842135 | Event: Closed Record | Mounika Chakka\n8/21/2025 12:37 PM | SCTS016842135 | Case Closure Summary\nProblem Description:\n1: Versions of Apps and Platform:4.5.3 / 11.5\n2: Problem Description:\nCustom sections in forms resize width as the browser window size is changed but the height appears fixed\nregardless of browser window size.\nThe commonly affected form sections are GIS and BIM Viewer tabs.\nIs there a way to change the height or for it to dynamically resize to the browser window as it does for width?\nSee attached screenshots.\n3: Data gathered, your observations from it.\nSupport has observed that , even in our OOTB environments we see that the height size is not equal to browser\nheight.We feel that the functionality is working as designed.\n7: Question/Expectation from Dev Team and QA Team\nCould you please confirm if this would be a RFE or is there any way to change the height.\nResolution Description:\nKnown Issue has been created.\nMC\n9/10/2024 3:58 PM|Internal|Riya Gupta on SCTS016842135at TRI|TRI: Default\nBy: @support\nThis issue is in platform code and it is not there in custom class loader.

Verify that the TRIRIGA CAD Integrator is properly configured to load automatically in AutoCAD Architecture.\nAccording to the documentation, you need to manually configure the necessary registry entries.\n2. Open the Registry Editor by pressing Windows + R keys and typing regedit in the Run dialog box.\n3. Navigate to the AutoCAD Applications Registry Path:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Autodesk\\AutoCAD\\R24.2\\ACAD-6104:409\\Applications.\n4. Create a New Registry Key for TRIRIGA CI by right-clicking on the Applications folder, selecting New > Key,\nand naming it \"TRIRIGA CI\".\n5. Add the required values under the \"TRIRIGA CI\" Key:\n- String Value: Description = \"TRIRIGA CAD Integrator\"\n- DWORD (32-bit) Value: LOADCTRLS = 2\n- String Value: LOADER = (full path to the CI DLL file, e.g., C:\\Program Files\\TRIRIGA\\CI\\tririga_ci.dll)\n- DWORD (32-bit) Value: MANAGED = 1\n6. Verify that the registry key setup matches the expected configuration:\n- Description: String Value = \"TRIRIGA CAD Integrator\"\n- LOADCTRLS: DWORD (32-bit) = 2\n- LOADER: String Value = (full path to the CI DLL file)\n- MANAGED: DWORD (32-bit) = 1\n7. Restart AutoCAD Architecture to ensure the TRIRIGA CAD Integrator loads automatically.\nIf the issue persists after following these steps, you might need to investigate further into the specific error\nmessage \"command unknown\" and how it relates to the CAD Integrator and Oracle Java integration. The\ndocumentation provided focuses on configuring the CAD Integrator to load in AutoCAD Architecture, but it\ndoesn't directly address the \"command unknown\" error or the Oracle Java integration specifics.\nThis may help you resolve the initial loading issue, and you can then focus on troubleshooting the \"command\nunknown\" error separately.\nAccuracy:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nReadability:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nUsed\nFeedback\nDetailed Feedback\nAG\n9/6/2025 6:02 AM|Internal|Agent_Watson\nWiS Automation provided the following data to the service desk\ncdscasenumber: TS020228920\ncdsproduct: Facilities and Real Estate Management on Cloud (TRIRIGA)\ncdsmissionteam: IoT-CDS TRIRIGA\ncdsskill: N/A\ncdsaccountname: ECIFM SOLUTIONS INC\ncdsaccountcmr: 8294039\ncdssiteurl: bam.tririga.com\ncdscaseseverity: 2\ncdscaseid: 500gJ0000049VIPQA2\ncdssupportmissionalias: CLD\ncdscaseentitlement: Embedded Solution Agreement\ncdscasespecialhandling: IoT TRIRIGA - Facilities and Real Estate Management on Cloud (TRIRIGA)\ncdscountry: US\ncdsregion: NA\ncdslinktocase: https://ibmsf.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Case/500gJ0000049VIPQA2/view\ncdscreatedatetime: Sat Sep 06 2025 00:32:19 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)\n(7c48ef00-b984-4191-9363-310a5af11b50)\nAG\n9/6/2025 6:02 AM|Internal|Agent_Watson\nWiS Automation started collecting data to send to the service desk.\n(7c48ef00-b984-4191-9363-310a5af11b50)\n9/6/2025 6:02 AM|Internal|Doug Woodroofe (Customer)\nCase Summary post indicates the current values of these fields, not the values as they were submitted\nSubject: Cook County - CAD Integrator issue\nProblem Description:\nHi,\nThe client, Cook Country, has AutoCAD 2021 Architecture and installed CAD Integrator 13.5 with Oracle JAVA.\nAt first they would launch AutoCAD and the TRIRIGA menu was not appearing.
